class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int max=0;
        for(int i=0;i<sentences.length;i++)
        {
         max   =     Math.max(max,countWord(sentences[i]));
        }
        return max;

    }
    static int countWord(String str)
    {
        String []str1=str.split(" ");
