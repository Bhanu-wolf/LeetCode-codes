You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        int count=0;

        {
count=count+countjewels(jewels.charAt(i),stones);
        }
        return count;
    }
